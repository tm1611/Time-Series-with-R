Repo merge: "Time-Series-Analysis" merged in "Time-Series-with-R"

This repo contains applications of time series methods in R. In addition to some simple R-scripts I have also added some analyses using RMarkdown (notebook interface of R) which should be more appealing as they contain visualizations, formulas and explanations. I have added an extra folder of the final RMarkdown products and previews of can be accessed using the following links:
