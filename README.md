# Time-Series-with-R
Notes and Code of the "Time Series with R" Track on DataCamp. 

My suggestion is to download the repository to see the files correctly in your browser or simply copy/paste the URL of the respective html file into this [preview tool](http://htmlpreview.github.io/).

I have also provided markdown (.md) files but they look different as visualizations as well as the formatting is not always correct.
